## Towards Attention-Adaptive Learning Information Systems
Â© Colin Conrad and Aaron Newman, 2021

The file repository of scripts used for our 2018 study _Neurophysiological Indicators of Attention in Information Technology Use_, REB 2018-4404 at Dalhousie University, done through the [NeuroCognitive Imaging Lab](https://ncil.science/). This study was later nicknamed "aalis" for short, standing for "attention adaptive learning information systems". 

In this folder you will find our analysis scripts for the project. All files consist of Jupyter notebooks that leverage the Python or R programming language. The repository contains scripts for individual analysis of the 48 participants analyzed in the study, as well as scripts used to generate the statistical analysis, grand average images, and bar charts. Feel free to use these materials to support your own analysis; if you do, please cite our paper using the information below.
